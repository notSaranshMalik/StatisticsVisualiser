# Statistics Visualiser

## Overview
This program allows for quick visualisation of independent T-Tests and Chi-Squared tests. Data can be imported for exploratory analysis, or random data can be generated as a tool to teach these 2 concepts in statistics classes.

## T-Test 
Data can either be imported (as a CSV file) or randomly generated. Imported data should be a 2 column CSV file, where a column has all numeric samples for a specific variable.

For random data, every time the test is run, new data is randomly generated, from which a T-value and the corresponding P-value is calculated.

## Chi Squared Test
Data can either be imported (directly input into the program in a table) or randomly generated.

For random data, every time the test is run, a new sample is randomly taken. Running once visually shows a sample being taken, followed by it being plotted and values being described. Running multiple times quickly plots data to the grpah, allowing for a comparison to the null hypothesis to be taken. Clicking show line shows what the distribution should look like as the number of samples approaches infinity, which can be used to show the comparison compared to the null hypothesis.

 For imported data, using the export buttons allows the user to export the data in the table (which can be imported later to quickly pick up with the same example). This way, examples can be made and quickly used in class without typing them out manually.
